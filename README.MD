This is a news aggregator site I'm working on.

Users can visit the site and see info from top news article headlines along with descriptions, images, and links to the articles' sources.

The primary tools for building it are Express, React, and News API.

User Stories / MVP Goals:

Users can visit the site and see info from top news article headlines along with descriptions, images, and links to the articles' sources. The site will be in a layout optimized for a news/media content site.

Users can see the top news headlines by country.

Users can see the top news headlines for different news categories.

Users can search for and get a list of news articles.
