This is a news aggregator site I'm working on.  The focus is on responsive design and involving TDD as I go.  The primary tools for building it are Express, React, and News API.

User Stories / MVP Goals:

Users can visit the site and see info from top news article headlines along with descriptions, images, and links to the articles' sources. The site will be in a layout optimized for a news/media content site.

Users can see the top news headlines by country.

Users can see the top news headlines for different news categories.

Users can search for and get a list of news articles.

To check out the project locally, get an API key from https://newsapi.org.  Then clone or download the repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`, and go to http://localhost:8080 in a browser.
